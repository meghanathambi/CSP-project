    &emsp;Traditional health care methods are holistic and time-tested practices that have been passed down through generations. Rooted in the use of naturally available resources—such as plant extracts, minerals, and animal-based ingredients—these methods include systems like Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, acupuncture, herbal remedies, Panchakarma, yoga, and meditation. They emphasize prevention, natural healing, and the balance of body, mind, and spirit.

    &emsp;Rooted in tradition yet relevant today, Ayurveda, yoga and meditation, and herbal remedies offer sustainable solutions for physical and mental well-being.
Ayurveda focuses on maintaining health by balancing bodily energies through diet, lifestyle, and herbal treatments. Yoga and meditation promote physical flexibility, mental clarity, and emotional balance. Herbal remedies utilize the healing properties of plants to support the body’s natural healing processes with minimal side effects.

    &emsp;As part of this community service project, these traditional techniques were effectively introduced and promoted within the rural community. The initiative aimed to raise awareness about the significance of natural healing methods, encouraging villagers to adopt these practices for improved physical health and mental well-being.
